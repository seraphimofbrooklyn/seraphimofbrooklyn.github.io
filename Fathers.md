**St. John Cassian**
> He related with regard to another old man living in the desert,
that he had asked God to grant him never to become sleepy during
a spiritual conference, but, if someone uttered slanderous or useless
words, to be able to go to sleep at once, so that his ears should never
be touched by that poison. This old man also said that the devil,
enemy of all spiritual instruction, works hard to provoke useless
words. He used the following example, 'Once when I was talking
to some brothers on a helpful topic, they were overcome by sleep
so deep, that they could not even move their eyelids any longer.
Then, wishing to show them the power of the devil, I introduced
a trivial subject of conversation. Immediately, they woke up, full
of joy. Then I said to them with many sighs, "Until now, we were
discussing heavenly things and your eyes were heavy with sleep, but
when I embarked on a useless discourse, you all woke up with
alacrity. Therefore, brothers, I implore you to recognize the power
of the evil demon; pay attention to yourselves, and guard yourselves
from the desire to sleep when you are doing or listening to something spiritual. - From the Sayings of the Desert Fathers
