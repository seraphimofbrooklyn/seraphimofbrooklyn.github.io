### Short History of Darwinism

**Charles Darwin** was one of the most important figures of modernity along with Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud. Their ideas formed the intellectual and scientific foundation for many of the political movements that we saw in the 20th century including the many socialist movements (mainly Marx), as well as the reactionary fascist movements (Darwin and Nietzche). While it is common knowledge that **Nazism and racial eugenics were heavily inspired by Darwinian evolution being applied to humans**, it is less widely known that once racial eugenics fell out of fashion post WW2  the same prominent eugenics advocates rebranded themselves as experts in **'genetics'**, and **'family planning'**.

Darwin was supported by **Thomas Henry Huxley**, nicknamed Darwins bulldog, and his close friend Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker. In the historic 1860 Oxford evolution debate, they defended the Darwinian theory of evolution against its detractors. They were also both members of the X-Club which dominated the **Royal Society** in the late 19th century with 3 consecutive presidents (1873-1885) being members of the X-Club. He was also supported by his half-cousin **Francis Galton**. The three families (Galton, Darwin, and Huxley) were extremely important in the eugenics movement in Britain.

In the era before Darwinism universities did not grant biology degrees, and most biologists were self-taught. Through the efforts of Thomas Henry Huxley, and the Royal Society it biology soon established itself with comparative anatomy remaining at the core of biology curriculums until the advent of more specialized fields of biology. Darwinism's influence very quickly expanded to all areas of society, even outside of what we consider science today with significant consequences in philosophy, metaphysics, and theology.

### Short History of Eugenics

The two main works of Darwin are the *On the Origin of Species* written in 1859 and the *Descent of Man* written in 1871. Francis Galton and Ernst Haeckel, both famous eugenicists, were deeply influenced by Darwin and his works, and easily applied the theory of evolution and natural selection to humanity. It was Galton who coined the phrase 'eugenics' in 1883, one year after Charles Darwin's death. Haeckel promoted Darwins work in Germany, paving the way for the atrocities to come. However, even before the popularization of the term the seeds of eugenics had already been planted. As you can see in a paragraph from Chapter 5 of the *Descent of Man* Darwin shows contempt for the weak, the poor, and the mentally unfit and notes that **their genetic pool is *"highly injurious to the race of man"***.

</figure>

One often hears the white-washed history which seeks to disconnect Darwin from the ugly legacy of eugenics, and to imply that it took seedy figures to twist it into genocidal policy. **But this idea that one could improve the human race by preventing the 'undesirables' from reproducing was already present at least 30 years before the explosion societies promoting eugenics in the early 20th century**. Darwin not only himself believed in the concept of eugenics, he also endorsed Francis Galton, and Haeckel Haus. In personal correspondence to Haeckel he says *"I can clearly see that you are one of the few who clearly understand Natural Selection.".*, and to Galton on *Heriditary Genius* which cited *On the Origin of Species* as a major influence...

  >"MY DEAR GALTON,--I have only read about 50 pages of your book (to Judges), but I must exhale myself, else something will go wrong in my inside. I do not think I ever in all my life read anything more interesting and original--and how Well and clearly you put every point!".

Not to mention that it was promulgated and legitimized by the intellectual elite at the time including Huxley's grandson Julian Huxley, and many of Charles Darwin's sons, and grandsons. Two of Darwin's sons Leonard Darwin, and Sir George Howard Darwin were champions of eugenics. **Leonard Darwin even became chairman of the British Eugenis Society (BES) from 1911 to 1928**, succeeding his relative Francis Galton. One of his grandsons, **Charles Galton Darwin**, was the BES president 1953-1959 and early 60s. All were well respected members of the Royal Society.

How deeply did the theory of evolution penetrate the souls of these well-respected and richly adorned scientists? Galton believed that Darwin's ideas would eventually evolve into a 'eugenic religion', designed to promote a genetically fitter human species, and wrote *Kantsaywhere* based on this. On a parallel track, T. H. Huxley's grandson **Julian Huxley**, a famous eugenicist who was president of the BES from 1959-1962, said this about eugenics.

>"I find myself inevitably driven to use the language of religion, for the fact is that all this does add up to something in the nature of a religion: perhaps one might call it Evolutionary Humanism.  The word “religion” is often used restrictively to mean belief in gods; but I am not using it in this sense….I am using it in a broader sense, to denote an overall relation between man and his destiny, and one involving his deepest feelings, including his sense of what is sacred.  In this broad sense, evolutionary humanism, it seems to me, is capable of becoming the germ of a new religion, not necessarily supplanting existing religions but supplementing them."

From this point on I am going a network analysis of major eugenics organizations, their funders, and founders. Then I will hone in on major centers and provide brief explanations of their importance.

### Network Overview
<figure>
	<img src="/images/eugenics/11-16-Overview.png">
	<figcaption> Figure 2: Overall network. Major nodes centered around Eugenics Record Office (purple), Nazis (red), Margaret Sanger and American Birth Control League (blue), British Eugenics Society (dark green), Royal Society (light green) and American Eugenics Society (orange).
</figcaption>
</figure>

First thing to note is that several organizations have 'rebranded here', including **American Birth Control League** to **Planned Parenthood** in 1942, the **American Eugenics Society** to the **Society for Biodemography and Social Biology** in 1973, and the **British Eugenics Society** to the **Galton Institute** in 1989. Their journals have changed names as well; from the British **The Eugenics Review** to the **Journal of Biosocial Science** in 1969, and the American Eugenical News to **Eugenics Quarterly** in 1954, to Social Biology in 1969 Biodemography and Social Biology in 2008. This of course is a similar tactic that the US Department of War had used when they changed their name to the Department of Defense in 1949.  

The second thing to note is that this network is extremely complicated and I can provide the spreadsheet that I used to import into Gephi in my github/images/eugenics in case anybody wants it. I generally weight connections higher if an individual directly funds, or founds an organization, and if there are indications that an individual inspires another (as in the case of Madison Grant and Hitler). Lets dive into the key organizations and figures.

## Major Organizations of Eugenics

### Eugenics Report office (ERO) at Cold Spring Harbor Labratory (CSHL)
This was a research institute founded in 1910 within the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory under the **Carnegie Institute** of Washington Station for Experimental Evolution. It was funded by the **Mrs. Mary Harriman** (wife of railroad magnate E. H. Harriman), the **Rockefeller Foundation**, and the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and founded by **Charles Davenport**, and **Harry Laughlin** (more on them later). It served as the scientific centre for researching eugenics and human heredity in America. Many of the people associated with the ERO were founders or members of groups that promoted eugenics such as John Harvey Kellog (Racial Betterment Foundation) .

### American Eugenics Society (AES)
The American Eugenics Society was formed in 1922 after the 2nd International Congress on Eugenics (ICE in orange in the overview) by **Madison Grant, Harry H. Laughlin, Irving Fisher, Henry Fairfield Osborn, and Henry Crampton**.  Other prominent members and sponsors included **Margaret Sanger, John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan, C.C. Little, and Lothrop Stoddard**.  They promoted ideas like racial betterment, birth control, population control, racial hygiene, eugenic health, and eugenic education that led to government-enforced sterilizations (most notably Buck v. Bell) and anti-miscegenation laws. A secondary function was to organize and promote the work of smaller American eugenics organization like the Racial Betterment Foundation and the Galton Society.

Henry F. Perkins, president of AES from 1931-1933, worked with Margaret Sanger and the Birth Control League, the predecessor of Planned Parenthood. Several of their members such as Madison Grant, Lothrop Stoddard, and Davenport had ties to members of the Nazi party. After eugenics fell from favor after WW2 their focus shifted to genetic analysis and human evolution.

### National Socialist Party of Germany (Nazis)
Obviously this group needs no introduction. Despite one's familiarity it must be noted there are many American connections, and one can even say that at one point the Nazis looked to America for scientific and ideological guidance due to how highly developed eugenics research and thought was in America.

### Margaret Sanger and American Birth Control League/Planned Parenthood (ABCL/PP)
Margaret Sanger is a modern day icon, but much of her legacy is tainted by her belief in eugenics and her association with many of the most prominent eugenicists of the day.

### Rockefellers
The Rockefellers, and especially John D. Rockefeller were particular interested in improving the human condition.

### 21st Century legacy


Rockefeller Foundation - Funded Negro Project, ERO.
Human Betterment League (1947)


Key names: Julian Huxley - President of BES from 1959-1962. Father of author Aldous Huxley. Royal Society award recipients.

Clarence James Gamble - Grandson of founder of Proctor and Gamble. Director of ABCL (PP), President of Pennsylvania Birth Control Fedaration, state delegate, one of five vice-presidents, and member of the Executive Committee of the Board of the American Birth Control League; medical field director of Margaret Sanger's Birth Control Clinical Research Bureau, partnered with Sanger for Negro Project, founder of Pathfinder Fund, and founding member of Human Betterment League of NC in 1947. He got a letter from Sanger “We do not want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten that idea out if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.”

Leonard Darwin & Charles Darwin - Son and Father combo. Darwinism and social Darwinism set the intellectual backdrop. His son Leonard picked up the ball becoming chairman of BEC from 1911 to 1928, succeding his half-cousin once removed Francis Galton. Leonard held the 1st Int. Congress of Eugenics. Royal Society members.

Francis Galton - Coined the term eugenics, president from 1907-1911. He was inspired by his cousin Charles Darwin's work.
"In an effort to reach a wider audience, Galton worked on a novel entitled Kantsaywhere from May until December 1910. The novel described a utopia organised by a eugenic religion, designed to breed fitter and smarter humans."

Bill Gates Sr. - Director of PP

Charles Benedict Davenport - Cofounder of ERO@CSHL with Henry H Laughlin in 1910 and director there until 1934, and RBF with John Harvey Kellog and Fischer in 1906 .
