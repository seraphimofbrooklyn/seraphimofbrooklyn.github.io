    <td>夸父追著太陽跑,
靠近太陽時,
焦渴難耐想，
要得到水喝，
於是他痛飲黃河 ，
渭水之水。
黃河，渭水的水還不夠他喝，
又去北方的潮喝水。
還未到達，
就渴死在半路中。
死後，他丟 棄的手杖變成了一片桃林。。</td>
    <td> Kuafu ran after the sunlight. When he drew near, he became unbearably thirsty, and he needed to drink water so he drank his fill from the Yellow River and the Wei River. The Yellow River and Wei River were not enough for him so he went to the North to drink the tidal waters. Before he arrived, he died of thirst half-way. After his death, he threw away his walking stick and it became a peach orchard.
