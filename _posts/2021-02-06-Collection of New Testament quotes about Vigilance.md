# Introduction to Nepsis and Hesychia

Nepsis (νῆψις in Greek) and Hesychia (ἡσυχία in Greek) are two Greek terms used to describe fundamental aspects about Christian spiritual life. Nepsis means vigilance, and hesychia is silence or stillness. Only through the former is the latter achieved and maintained. This stillness is the **peace** that Christ so often mentioned by the Apostles (Colossians 3:15, 2 Thessalonians 3:16), and by Christ himself (John 14:27). Hesychia opens the door of the soul only to the Holy Spirit, while rejecting everything that seeks to take His place else through nepsis. Through the grace of the Holy Spirit, one is purified, illumined and perfected. This in short, is **theosis**.

Though it may appear that such a rigorous practice is only applicable to those living in monastic communities, the Orthodox do not categorically distinguish those who are laymen and those who are monks. The ascetic practices of monks are practiced by Orthodox laymen to varying degrees. Fasting and prayer are a routine and form the most important part of an Orthodox Christian life outside of participation in the Holy Mysteries. The most treasured gift of the Church is the **Jesus Prayer** (Lord Jesus Christ have mercy upon me a sinner) which exemplifies the watchfulness and sobriety demanded by Christ. This approach to faith and spirituality is foreign to the modern world, and even to other Christians. Here I would like to assemble quotes from the NT on this topic to demonstrate the biblical basis for this practice.

As a note I have also selected quotes that reference the **heart** which is directly related to vigilance as it is believed that the heart houses the soul. **In short, to guard one's heart is to guard one's soul** from idols that may compete for our attention and worship. The eyes are also cardinal to understanding vigilance so this too I have included in this collection of verses. As people often say... the eyes are the mirror to the soul, and to **look** to something is to be attentive to it. If we find ourselves obsessively looking at something or paying attention to something, this is a distraction and perhaps may even be an idol. For example, a person who is constantly checking his back account balance is doing so out of attention to his finances. Taken to an extreme, this attention to one's financial situation can become idolatrous.

To Christ, to lack attention to prayer and to God is to fall asleep, to have ones eyes closed, and effectively to be blind and in the darkness. To not be watchful is to let the thief break into the temple of the Holy Spirit (ie our souls). He warns about this most explicitly in the parable of the watchful servant, but this theme of blindness is scattered throughout all of the New Testament.

# The Synoptic Gospels

### Temptation of Christ in the Wilderness in Matthew 4: 1-11, Mark 1:12-13 and Luke 4:1-13 (Only Matthew 4:1-4 shown here)

> Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 3 The tempter came to him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.” 4 Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”

I start here because this is a synopsis of spiritual warfare. When we take up our cross and decide to let God leads us into the wilderness, the tempter will come and try to lead us away from God. If we are hungry he will tempt us with gluttony. If we are lonely he will tempt us with lust and fornication. If we lack material wealth (or even have material wealth) he will tempt us with greed. In face of these temptations we must not fall asleep.

### Matthew 5:8
> Blessed are the pure in heart, For they shall see God.

Without purifying our hearts we shall not see God. Such purity can only be achieved by guarding our hearts from temptation, and through the purifying grace of the Holy Trinity. It is even possible in this life to see God and to have true knowledge of Him through experiencing His light.

### Matthew 5: 27-31, Matthew 18:9, Mark 9:47

> 27 You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ 28 **But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.** 29 **If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.** 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.

Christ emphasizes the eyes as attention is indicative of the state of our heart. At times, the eyes of the soul (as in the case of lusting after a woman) is looking at the very same thing our physical eyes are looking at. To covet with ones eyes, is to covet with ones heart. Such covetousness can become idolatry and a separation or movement from God. Thus, Christ warns against this.

### Parable of Treasure in Heaven and the Lamp of the Body in  Matthew 6:19-23 and Luke 11:33-36

> 19 Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 **For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also**. The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!

This holds a similar theme to the last verses. To lay treasures on earth is to love the things of this world too much, even good things like family and friends. If our heart is with the things of this earth, we have not been watchful and have closed our eyes. To Christ, a "good" eye is one that is affixed to the things of heaven, and principally to God, placing His Kingdom first. There is a theme of light, watchfulness, wakefulness, sobriety juxtaposed with darkness, distractedness, slumber, and stupor.

### Matthew 7:1-5

> 7 Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. 3 And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank is in your own eye? **5 Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.**

Again, Christ calls us to be attentive to the state of our own souls and be watchful. In light of the previous passage the "good" eye is one that is principally judging oneself rather than others. In most cases it is a distraction to be attentive to the state of others souls when our own estates are disordered.

### Matthew 10:28

> And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

Christ prophetically alludes to the persecution and martyrs of Christians to come and tells them not fear those who will come and destroy the body so long as they safeguard the soul with faith in Christ. He also reminds us that fear of God is warranted, and to avoid the destruction of our souls and bodies in the next life, we must guard our hearts in this life.

### Matthew 12:35-27 and Luke 6:45

> **35 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.** 36 But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.

### Matthew 15:8-9 and Mark 7:6-7

> 8 These people draw near to Me with their mouth,
And honor Me with their lips,
But their heart is far from Me.
9 And in vain they worship Me,
Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.

This is in reference to the Pharisees and the religious leaders at the time who payed strict attention to the letter of the law but not to the spirit. However, this is still applicable to Christians today as it is a warning that our prayers are "vain" if we honor God with our lips yet our hearts are not with Him in Spirit.

### Matthew 15:17-20 and Mark 7:18-23

> 17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? **18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.** 20 These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.

If we not do not have Christ in our hearts but something else, then evil thoughts will proceed, as well as all other forms of sin. This is in accordance with what we have already established in prior verses.

### Matthew 16:6, Mark 8:15, and Luke 12:1

> 6 Then Jesus said to them, “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.”

The leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees is that of hypocrisy and of following the letter of the Law and not of the Spirit, of being externally righteous but internally depraved. Hypocrisy can only be combatted through humility, meekness, and vigilance.

### Matthew 16:23-27 and Mark 8:33-38

>23 But He turned and said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for **you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.”**

> 24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. 25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 26 **For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?** 27 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works.

Here Christ rebukes Peter for being **mindful** of the things of men rather than the things of God. He even goes so far as to call him Satan as if Peter were Satan himself, or possessed by Satan. In the next few verses he calls them to a life of self-denial and again to guard their souls.

### Matthew 23:26-28

> 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but **inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness**. 28 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but **inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.**

This is related to the leaven of the Pharisees. Again, although this is addressed explicitly to the Pharisees it is important that Christians do not themselves become Pharisaical in their manner of living. We are called to be holy, and not just to preach holiness.

### Matthew 24:42-44, Luke 21:36, and Mark 13:35-37

> 42 **Watch therefore**, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, **he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into.** 44 Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.

> 34 “But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with carousing, drunkenness, and cares of this life, and that Day come on you unexpectedly. 35 For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth. 36 **Watch therefore**, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.”

> 35 **Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming**—in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning— 36 lest, coming suddenly, **he find you sleeping**. 37 And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!”

"Watch therefore" that Christ does not return on a day when we are drunk, asleep, and unprepared for His coming. The house that Christ mentions in Matthew 24:23 is our very beings, our bodies that house our soul and spirit. If we are inattentive a thief may break in. In other words the thief (Satan) is always trying to break in, and we must be watchful as to stop him from entering. Rather we must invite God into the house of our soul.

### **Parable of the Faithful/Watchful Servant** in Matthew 24:45-51 and Luke 12:35-48

>45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? **46 Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing**. 47 Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods. 48 But if that evil servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of, 51 and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

> 35 Let your waist be girded and your **lamps burning**; 36 and you yourselves be like men who wait for their master, when he will return from the wedding, that when he comes and knocks they may open to him immediately. 37 **Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching**. Assuredly, I say to you that he will gird himself and have them sit down to eat, and will come and serve them. 38 And if he should come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.

In light of the rest I only need to repeat this verse from Christ. "Blessed are those servants whom the master, when he comes, will find watching".

### **Parable of the Wise Virgins** Matthew 25:1-13

>1 Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 3 Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them, 4 **but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.**
5 But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all **slumbered and slept**. And at midnight a cry was heard: ‘Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!’ 7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 9
But the wise answered, saying, ‘No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’ 10 And while they went to buy, **the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding**; and the door was shut.
11 “Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us!’ 12 But he answered and said, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ **“Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.**

This parable is about Christ and the Church, or Christ and the world. Those wise virgins who are attentive will keep watch for when the bridegroom (Christ) returns. Having been prepared with oil for their lamps prior to his arrival, the wise virgins, despite falling asleep, were able to enter into the divine bridal chamber. Christ warns us not to be those foolish virgins and forget our oil, which is the spiritual labors we must partake in this life in preparation for the next. Those foolish virgins were physically prepared for the bridegroom as they were virgins, but spiritually unprepared. So Christians, who  although are baptized and physically pure through abstinence and sobriety, too must be vigilant.

### **The Prayer in the Garden** Matthew 26:36-46, Mark 14:32-42, Luke 22: 39-46

> 36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go and pray over there.” 37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38 Then He said to them, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. **Stay here and watch with Me.”**
39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.”
40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “What! **Could you not watch with Me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.** The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”
42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, “O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.” 43 And **He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.**
44 So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them, **“Are you still sleeping and resting?** Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.”

The cyclical nature of the Apostles behavior is an apt description of our own behavior towards God. While God tries to rouse us to be united to Him through prayer, we fall back asleep, and if we awake it is only for a short while before we fall asleep again.

### Martha and Mary Luke 10:38-42

>38 Now it happened as they went that He entered a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house. 39 And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard His word. 40 **But Martha was distracted** with much serving, and she approached Him and said, “Lord, do You not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Therefore tell her to help me.”
41 And Jesus answered and said to her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things. 42 **But one thing is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which will not be taken away from her.**”

These last verses from Luke detail the distinction between the active life and the contemplative life. This is not to disparage the need to serve and to love one another. Rather, it is to call to mind that **there is only one thing needful: Christ.**

# The Epistles

The Apostles continue this and exhorts us to be vigilant, sober, and watchful against temptation from the evil one. I will refrain from excess commentary as it is mostly straightforward from here.

### Ephesians 5:14

>13 But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light. 14 Therefore He says:
**“Awake, you who sleep**,
Arise from the dead,
And Christ will give you light.”

### The Whole Armor of God Ephesians 6:10-18  

> 11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might. 14 Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, **being watchful** to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints—

### Philippians 4:6-8

> 6 Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; 7 **and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus**.

The Orthodox Church believes that once a Christian is baptized and chrismated, one is emptied through the purifying waters of baptism accomplished by the grace of God, and filled with the Holy Spirit (through the entrance of the Holy Spirit via one's personal Pentecost accomplished through the holy chrism). Thus one is born of water and the Spirit. It is to be emptied, and to be filled. Once we are filled, the attack from the devil is always from without rather than from within, and God guards our hearts and minds.

### The Day of the Lord 1 Thessalonians

>5 But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you. 2 For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 3 For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. 4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. 5 You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. 6 **Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 8 But let us who are of the day be sober**, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation. 9 For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him.

### 2 Timothy 4:5

> 5 But you be **watchful in all things**, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

### 1 Peter 4:7

> But the end of all things is at hand; therefore be **serious and watchful in your prayers**.

### 1 Peter 5:8

>8 **Be sober, be vigilant**; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.

# Conclusion

I will end with St. John's account of his vision of Christ speaking to the Church in Revelations. It is interesting to note that Christ describes **Himself** as "a thief" whereas in the prior accounts the thief is Satan. This is an example of the multivalent nature of symbols. Already I have excluded many other verses from the NT but I picked the ones that were most explicitly

### Revelations 3:2-3

> 2 **Be watchful**, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die, for I have not found your works perfect before God. 3 Remember therefore how you have received and heard; hold fast and repent. **Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you as a thief, and you will not know what hour I will come upon you.**
