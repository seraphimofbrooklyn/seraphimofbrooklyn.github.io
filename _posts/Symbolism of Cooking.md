### Introduction to Eating and Identity

Though it may not seem obvious, food and eating is a central part of the Bible, and of the Christian narrative. Time and time again, and across the Old Testament and into the New Testament there are images of **bread** and **wine**. More explicitly, the heavenly Father is the one who provides our daily bread, both in the form of physical and spiritual sustenance.

But what does it mean to eat? To consume is to assume into ourselves. At the most physical level every organism has to incorporate some aspect from that which is external to them in order to continue to survive. This remains true at every scale whether you take the example of a single-cellular organism, a human, or a large body of humans like a city. This consumption and eventual assumption into ourselves reproduces our identity and creates or maintains our body. At the small scale bacteria in cell cultures consume growth medium, and create more body by reproducing. On the human scale most would prefer not to create more body, as most would prefer to lose weight or not reproduce.

When a macrophage engulfs and digests foreign particles, the foreign particle ceases to be *foreign* and becomes a part of the macrophage. Similarly, when we eat bananas, it ceases to be a banana because its identity is dissolved, and eventually it becomes a part of us, gaining a new identity as a part of us. This remains true even for non-physical identities that can be assigned a degree of agency (like capitalism, patriarchy, liberalism etc). For example, the superstructure of a culture can "digest" foreign cultures and ethnicities them until they are no longer foreign. This is what historically has happened to an ethnic group when immigrating to America eventually being culturally assimilated as in the case of Italian-Americans or Irish-Americans.

Cultural assimilation can also apply across borders. For example, Western imperialism goes far beyond the military and economic projection of power beyond borders because it also includes the projection of Western culture. In the same manner a macrophage engulfs a particle to assimilate it into itself, Western culture can engulf another culture to assimilate it into itself. One can also use spiritual terms to describe the way that identities form and are consumed. The people of Hong Kong, are "possessed" by the Western spirit, and the spirit takes body or shape through the embodiment of itself in its people. Hong Kongers compared to their brethren in the mainland use more English in their language, eat more Western food, consume more Western media, etc. The spirit is embodied in the people and their actions. One can say that the recent HK protests in 2019 was a conflict between the spirit of the West, and the Spirit of China.

To be able to successfully consume something is to be able to successfully assimilate it into ourselves. However, there are things that are "unconsumable" in the sense that it will cause illness or even death. A good and healthy meal will be pleasurable, and we maintain our body and identity through such a meal. On the other hand, food that cannot be assimilated is expelled and in a similar manner that people are exiled or ethnic groups are expelled. In the severe case of death from food poisoning complete dissolution is possible through the breakdown of our bodies into its material parts; carbon, nitrogen, calcium, etc. Identity is also broken down, as there is no longer a body to sustain it in the world. Analogously, a culture/spirit that cannot be assimilated can cause the death of the original culture like in the case of the Russian Revolution that transformed imperial Russia into Soviet Russia.

To eat is also to know. To bring this back to the Bible and specifically to Genesis... To eat of the knowledge of good and evil is to know something that cannot be assimilated, and instead causes death. In a way it was both a physical and spiritual poisoning of Adam and Eve that causes the curse of death.
