### Introduction

Narrative and story-telling are often presented as something opposed to "science" or the scientific method. Myths, fairy-tales and stories are seen as ways of describing natural phenomena, or fantastical recountings of subjective experiences, while science is objective, quantitative, and "real". Science is a superior way of describing the world.

But what if science was just one of the many tools that we have to describe the world, and that it is, like the other tools that we as a species use to describe things, a form of story-telling? The scientific paradigm can be characterized as a story with different characters, microscopic or macroscopic forces replacing the gods or heroes, numbers replacing poetical language to describe states of being. For this essay I will focus in on the lipid hypothesis, or the **lipid narrative**.

### Ancel Keys and the Seven Countries Study

Starting in the 1950s, Western medicine took a dramatic turn in nutrition and diet. This turn was characterized by a marked decrease in consumption of animal fats, and increase in consumption of unsaturated fats (mainly vegetable oils). You may have heard of the saying that cholestrol clogs the arteries. It is a narrative driven interpretation of measured phenomena pertaining to cardiovascular health. And thats okay! I do not say it is narrative driven to discount it. Rather I am merely saying that all data **must** be converted into a narrative structure in order for us to understand data.

This story starts with the Seven Countries Study (SCS) in 1958. The main characters are the diet and biomarkers of 12,763 men from the US, Finland, Italy, Greece, Japan, Yugoslavia, and the Netherlands. The men's blood cholestrol, blood pressure, BMI, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were measured by researchers to establish a baseline and then the cohorts were revisted in 5, 10 and even 15 years to gather data on their biomarkers, and cause of death if a participant passed away. Their diets were recorded mainly through seven-day diet recall diaries, and their food was weighed by dieticians. Samples were also sent to the University of Minnesota for chemical analyses (macronutrient breakdown).

What the researchers found was that the three countries with the lowest rates death from heart disease (Greece, Japan) happened to have lower rates of saturated fat consumption, and North Karelia, Finland which had the highest consumption of fats also had the highest rate of deaths heart disease. So the story is clear isn't it? Diets high in saturated fats correlate with high serum cholestrol, and also correlates with CHD deaths.

The result of this (along with the Hegsted Equation and Framingham Heart Study) was the publishing of the ***Dietary Guidelines for Americans*** which was first published in 1980, and recommended a reduction of dietary consumption of fat and animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs. Later on in 1992, the food pyramind (as shown below in Figure 3) with which many people are familiar. It recommends 6-11 servings of simple carbs. If one only ate pasta that would be 12 ounces of pasta at minimum and 22 ounces of pasta at maximum (one regular box of pasta is 16 oz).

### The Narrative Structure

What makes scientific studies a "narrative" is this. It must always condense details to a level that is digestible and informative. There is an infinite variety of details that the scientists could have focused on within the scope of the study but didn't. For example, common critique of the SCS include

* It didn't differentiate between different types of cholestrol High density lipids (LDL) vs Low density lipids (LDL) which is a better biomarker for cardiovasular disease
* It didn't differentiate between vegetable oils that are mainly composed of omega-3 fatty acids such as corn oil and soybean oil vs those that are mainly composed of omega-9 and omega-6 fatty acids such as avocado oil and olive oil. High ratios of omega-6 to other fatty acids are associated with inflammation, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses
* It only studied 7 countries, mainly Western and in the case of Japan an industrialized nation. Societies still living on ancestral diets low in poly unsaturated fat such as the Greenland Inuits have low rates of heart disease compared to Westerners

Plus it reasonably excluded details such as
* A recollection of their childhood and marriage life of each of the participants of the study
* The participant's thoughts on the diet and possible causes of heart disease
* The weather conditions during the study
* The political structure of each country
* The folkstories associated with their traditional foods

Analagously, stories do not include every single detail. They describe only things that are **relevant**. For example, *1984* by Orwell doesn't go into the macronutrient breakdown of the slop that the citizens of Oceania are served, nor does it need to do a technical breakdown of the hardware of the telescreens that surveil every residence of Oceania. Every story, (including scientific studies) must necessarily **include** certain elements that are relavant and **exclude** those that are not relevant.

Stories are extremely conscious about what elements to include, because they will either contribute to the point of the story, or be irrelevant. Likewise stories are conscious of what elements to exclude, because the inclusion of certain things can take away from the point of the story, or also be irrelevant. To bring this back to the model... on Figure 2 the Inuit population according to a study in 1980 [3] would have roughly 1 death per 100, despite consuming similar amounts of saturated fat as the Finnish cohort. If you want to see how I did this math please see the end of this.
