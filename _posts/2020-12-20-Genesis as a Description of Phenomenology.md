### Introduction to Phenomenology

Genesis is the book chapter of the Pentateuch, and hence the first book of both the Jewish and Christian Scriptures. By scientists and their zealous sycophants, both of whom are modernist in their way of thought, it is often derided as a "myth" or a "narrative", thrown away as a by-gone description of creation as the more simple-minded ancients understood it. By fundamentalists, the creation story is understood as a literal account, from which nothing can be questioned. From both sides, the verity of Genesis hinges on whether or not it "literally" happened, but I would like to present an interpretation of Genesis that seeks to enrich the understanding of one of the most important texts of world religions that doesn't require an answer to whether or not it "literally" happened. This is not to deny or affirm creation ex-nihilo but to put aside that question temporarily for the purpose of this essay. Phenomenological and epistemological approaches to exegesis of Genesis will be the focus of this essay.

As I have introduced in another [essay](https://seraphimofbrooklyn.github.io/Iconography_and_Christian_Symbolism_in_Modernity), the **names** of things are extremely important, and though we may not notice it today, it continues to be indispensable. **To name something is to single it out, to call it from the unknown**. For example, in a crowded room of students, the teacher will call out a student's name, and immediately a student who was once indistinguishable from every other student, is atomized and has attention called upon him. This we do everyday; name things in order to call attention to it.

Without the ability to distinguish an object from the many, the many objects that we see meld into a sea of chaos and unknown. In a manner they become non-existent. The "many" become one in a unified nebulous object. If you were on a hiking trail in a forest in the middle of the night with no moonlight nor flashlight, you would not be able to tell where you are even with the trail markers simply because you wouldn't be able to see them.  The darkness is all-consuming and is "one" despite all of the objects that it contains, like trees, leaves, branches, paths, etc. In a similar fashion, if you were on a boat in the middle of a lake, it would be very difficult to see below the surface of the water (especially at night), and even if you were able to see below the surface of the water it would not be very deep below the surface. The water is also "one" and though it contains manifold things, both living and dead, which we cannot distinguish from another because we cannot see. **This inability to see is resolved through the presence of light, and the ability to name things**

If naming things brings attention to them, then the opposite is also true; the inability to name something means that it is often left unnoticed. For example, in my daily commute to and from work, I am unable to name the buildings that I see in the train, or all the streets that I pass on my way to work. They are all part of a singular, seamless, and undifferentiated experience that falls under this category that I would call "Brooklyn" or "commute in Brooklyn". Similarly, if I am unfamiliar with terminology of the flora of a specific biome, the only thing that I am able to say that it is a "forest" or a "swamp" or a "desert". It is only when I am able to identify a particular, like a maple sapling in the forest, or a pondweed in a body of water that I can pull out a semblance of order. The more I can name and classify the flora, the more order I can make sense out of the seemingly chaotic phenomena.

This is the basics of phenomenology, which is to frame the basis of knowledge on the experience of a mind, namely a mind similar to that of yours or mine. In other words, it seeks not "objectivity" as is championed by the scientific method, but seeks truth in the experience of phenomena by consciousness itself.

### Genesis - Heaven, Earth, and the Deep

>"In the beginning God created heaven and earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters". Genesis 1:1-2 [1]

1. What does heaven and earth mean?
2. And what does it mean for the earth to be without form, and "void".
3. What is the darkness and the "face of the deep"?

Heaven simply refers to the "spiritual" or non physical aspects of the universe. Earth refers to the material aspect of the universe. This model forms the basis for how we understand the world: unseen forces and laws govern visible phenomena. For example, the law of gravity (F=Gm1m2/r^2) describes the physical phenomena that explains why an apple falls from a tree. Even the most unbelieving scientists depend on such a union and interaction between "heaven" and "earth" in order to develop models to predict and describe physical phenomena.

Without form, and void comes from the hebrew words **"tohu"** and **"bohu"**. Tohu means confusion, formless, empty, desert, and nothing, all of which are synonyms to one another. The word Nothing may seem like it is not fitting here, but if we take into account consciousness and its ability to only notice things that are of importance, then it is totally intelligible. For example, if one were a criminal looking for a safe full of cash, then finding a safe that is full of bank records, social security cards, bills, and personal letters would may as well have been finding **nothing** in the safe at all because nothing that was found was important for the task at hand. In the primordial state of the universe, there was something, as it was already created in the first line ("In the beginning..."), but that "something" was in such a muddled state that it my as well have been empty or nothing at all. Bohu similarly means empty or void, reiterating the meaning of tohu perhaps through a reduplication [2] of the bohu.

Darkness is present because there was not yet light (created in Genesis 1:3), and because that seems to be the foundational state of consciousness. In the womb, we are either blind or simply see darkness. And out of the womb, as babies and infants, we do not fully develop eyesight until around one year old, seeing only blurred figures until it improves. Even after gaining sharper eyesight, we are ignorant about much of the state of the world, and it isn't until we learn things are we "enlightened". Through learning and experience do we go from darkness into light. Of course, the fundamental thing that we learn as children are the names of things.

The face of the deep, or "tehom", is another word for the darkness and is seen as the primordial waters, from which God brings forth all of creation. Linguists believe it is related to the Sumerian mythological diety Tiamat, who after being slain by Marduk, became the material Marduk used to form the heavens and Earth. There are also parallels in Chinese mythology through Pangu, the creator of the world who after dying became the basis for the material world. Tehom is also related to this idea of chaos, sometimes represented in the form of a serpent or a dragon that is defeated by a hero as in the case of Indra or Perseus. The account in Genesis represents a departure from such stories. Instead of serpents and heroes there is only the Spirit of God, which is identified with the 3rd person of the Trinity, the Holy Spirit.

### Genesis - Day and Night

>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.  And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.". Genesis 1:3-5

The 1st line when God created heaven and earth is a more general layout for the rest of the Creation narrative. The 3rd line of Genesis is actually the first thing that is created by God, and the first time the structure "Let there be.... " appears. From this point on God begins to create things, and proceeds to give them names. So the order of phenomena is as such: first there is darkness that is formless and void, then there is light. It is significant here that God "divides" the light from the darkness because it introduces the first duality of Creation. Similar dualities created later include Heaven and Earth (8 and 10 respectively), man and animal (26), and male and female (27). Where there was a "oneness" and primordial state of undifferentiation, God creates divisions (or unions depending on how you look at it).

To bring it back to phenomenology and the anthropocentric view, this is exactly how we perceive the world. The obvious observation is that we call the time of the day that has light "day" and the time when there is a lack of light "darkness". The more subtle notion introduced here is that it is through light that we make sense of darkness, both in the physical sense and in the epistemological sense. As mentioned earlier the introduction, if one enters a dark place, like the basement with no windows, it is impossible to tell one thing from another. It is only when the light is turned on (usually on the ceiling or other high place) or in one's hands via a flashlight or phone, can one begin to make out where objects are located, and objects in general. **The order of Creation in Genesis is structured such that it is congruent with our own experience of phenomena, which is that only through the presence of light can be begin to perceive and identify things in the darkness.**

The epistemological notion is that ignorance is often shrouded with language that implies darkness, while knowledge always has connotations of enlightenment. Illumination, enlightenment, awareness, insight, perception on one hand. All these have related meaning yet they all require sight which in turn requires light. On the other hand there is blindness, darkness, unawareness, unconsciousness, vagueness. Common phrases like "Ah I see", or "I'm in the dark" reflect this intuitive understanding that understanding is associated with light, and a lack of understanding with darkness.

From this point on God begins the bringing forth of the rest of creation, which will be not be the focus of the rest of this essay. The next section will skip ahead to creation of man and woman, and of their role in Creation.

### Adam as the mediator of Heaven and Earth

>"then the Lord God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being. And the Lord God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put man whom he had formed" Genesis 2:7-8

The name of "man" in Genesis is "Adam". The creation of Adam is also the creation of the race of mankind as the individual is a microcosm of the group. Adam is created in Genesis through the synthesis of "heaven" and "earth", or the immaterial breath of spirit, and the material dust of creation. In a similar manner to how symbols are unions of heaven and earth, man is as well, more specifically of the breath of life and dust.

</figure>

This union is pivotal to understanding the **central** role that humanity has in the universe. The centrality of man is reflected in his role as a "mediator" between heaven and earth. In the same way that God instructs man, and man obeys God, man "instructs" matter (or earth), and matter supports man. Matthew Pageau sums up man's role in the universe: *"informing matter with meaning and expressing meaning with matter"*[3]. This is similar to the relation between "higher" and "lower" shown in the structures in my [essay](https://seraphimofbrooklyn.github.io/The_Inevitability_of_Idols_and_Religions) on the inevitability of idols and religion. Below is the first figure in that essay.

</figure>

Even within the person there is a "heaven" and an "earth" in that have a head (or consciousness) and a body. The head informs the body, and the body supports the head. For example, if I wanted to read, I would inform my body to pick up the book, and the body supports the higher meaning by expressing that "meaning" through an observable action of picking up the book. In general, a person cannot survive without the cooperation of both, and an excess (or defect) of one over the other can destroy a person. In the specific case of man in relation to God and Creation in Genesis 2 it would look something like the following figure with a tripartite hierarchy:

<figure>
	<img src="/images/Genesis/Figure 3_God_Man_Matter.png">
	<figcaption> Figure 3: Similar model to Figure 1 but adapted to show Adam as a mediator</figcaption>
</figure>

Thus, this model precludes the possibility of mankind's "equality" with matter or Earth in the strict sense that modern thinking proposes. While modernists, more specifically environmentalists and animal rights activists, propose that homo sapiens is on the same level as *nature* or *Mother Earth* and oppose the dominion of man over nature, they inevitably manifest this order in their own lives and in the processes required to sustain those lives. Agriculture, even without livestock, is a strict practice that requires artificial manipulation of both the land and the actual crops, especially today with the advent of genetically modified organisms. On a more familiar level, the very act of eating food (vegan or not) is a manifestation of this pattern of reality. The person (heaven) informs food (earth) through the act of eating and digesting, and the matter supports the person by yielding nutrients and calories. **The principal act of survival is this interplay between "higher" and "lower".**

> "And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him." Genesis 2:19-20

The portion of Genesis quoted above describes Adam's role in the naming of the animals and is akin to a pre-historic precursor to the modern science of taxonomy and natural history. Made in the image of God, Adam acts too in the likeness of God by naming the animals like God named things like day or night. Again, it is an example of lowering spiritual meaning onto matter. By assigning names to things, Adam gives a spiritual identity to both fauna and flora alike in the same manner that the very source of Adam's identity comes from God. The examples of both eating and naming are closely intertwined as they are *"both examples of putting matter under influence of your spiritual authority"*[4]. The last thing to note before moving on is that, the role of man as "higher" or "lower" depends on the context in which he is placed. With respect to God, or the angels that he has to host (as in the case of Abraham in Genesis 18) he is the lower, but with respect to Creation, he is the higher.

### Paradise Lost
>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. Genesis 2:16-17

>"And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed." Genesis 2:25

And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
